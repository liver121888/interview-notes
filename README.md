Why did you want to leave the current company?

"I’ve learned a great deal at my current company, but I’ve reached a stage where I’m looking for a more structured environment with clearer strategic alignment. I’m very impressed by how [Target Company] prioritizes [Specific Project/Value], and I’m eager to contribute to a team 
that values long-term scalability."

"While I appreciate the foundation I've built at my current role, the scope for growth has become somewhat limited. I’m looking to apply my skills in [Your Skill] to a larger scale and more complex challenges, which is exactly 
what I see happening here at [Target Company]."
